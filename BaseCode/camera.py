    Description:
        Class for the camera that makes sure the character stays in the centre of the screen, with everything else moving
        around the character.

    Inherits:
        pygame.sprite.Group: Inherits from pygame's sprite class to make sprite interactions and functions easier to
        handle.

    Attributes:
        __screen (pygame.Surface):  the screen for which the camera will draw objects onto in their correct positions.
        __character_movement_offset (tuple): Vector for the offset to move all sprites due to the character moving.
        __character_image_offset (tuple): vector for the offset to move the character due to the size of the characters
        images, so that the image of the character is in the same place as its rect.
